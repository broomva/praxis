//! Filesystem port abstraction for Praxis tools.
//!
//! [`FsPort`] defines the filesystem operations that tools depend on.
//! The default [`LocalFs`] implementation wraps `std::fs` with workspace
//! boundary enforcement via [`FsPolicy`]. Alternative implementations
//! (e.g. tracked filesystems with event notification) can be injected.
